## 🗄️ Database Schema

Created a proper PostgreSQL schema for Supabase:

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  start TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  end TIMESTAMPTZ,
  color TEXT DEFAULT '#3788d8',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 🔄 Fallback System

The app now has a robust fallback system:

1. **Primary**: Supabase database (when properly configured)
